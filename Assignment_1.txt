1. Creating and Renaming Files/Directories
*                      Create a directory named test_dir using mkdir.
*                      Inside test_dir, create an empty file called example.txt.
*                      Rename example.txt to renamed_example.txt using mv
  

Command:-  mkdir test_dir
Creates a new folder (directory) called test_dir.
Command:- touch test_dir/example.txt
Creates an empty file named example.txt inside test_dir.
Command:- mv test_dir/example.txt test_dir/renamed_example.txt
Renames the file example.txt to renamed_example.txt inside test_dir.


2. Viewing File Contents
* Use cat to display the contents of /etc/passwd.
* Display only the first 5 lines of /etc/passwd using head.
* Display only the last 5 lines of /etc/passwd using tail.
  

  

Command:- cat /etc/passwd
 Shows the entire content of the file /etc/passwd on your screen.
Command:- head -n 5 /etc/passwd
 Shows only the first 5 lines of /etc/passwd.
Command:- tail -n 5 /etc/passwd
 Shows only the last 5 lines of /etc/passwd.
3.Searching for Patterns
* Use grep to find all lines containing the word "root" in /etc/passwd.
  

Command:- grep "root" /etc/passwd
Looks inside /etc/passwd and prints all lines that contain the word "root".
4. Zipping and Unzipping
* Compress the test_dir directory into a file named test_dir.zip using zip.
* Unzip test_dir.zip into a new directory named unzipped_dir.
  

Command:- zip -r test_dir.zip test_dir
 Compresses the test_dir folder and all its contents into a zip file named test_dir.zip. The -r means "recursive," so it includes everything inside the directory.

Command:- unzip test_dir.zip -d unzipped_dir
 Extracts the contents of test_dir.zip into a new directory called unzipped_dir.


5. Downloading Files
* Use wget to download a file from a URL (e.g., https://example.com/sample.txt).
  

Command:- wget https://example.com/sample.txt
Downloads the file located at the URL https://example.com/sample.txt and saves it in your current folder.
6. Changing Permissions
* Create a file named secure.txt and change its permissions to read-only for everyone using chmod.
  

Command:- touch secure.txt
Creates an empty file called secure.txt.
  

Command:- chmod 444 secure.txt
Changes the permissions of secure.txt so that everyone (owner, group, others) can only read the file but cannot write or execute it.
7. Working with Environment Variables
* Use export to set a new environment variable called MY_VAR with the value "Hello, Linux!".
  

Command:- export MY_VAR="Hello, Linux!"
Sets an environment variable named MY_VAR with the value "Hello, Linux!". This variable is now available to any programs or scripts started from this shell session.
